Every student is expected to create an original response to the open-ended DB question as well as engage in dialogue by responding to posts created by others throughout the week. At the end of each unit, DB participation will be assessed based on both level of engagement and the quality of the contribution to the discussion.

At a minimum, each student will be expected to post an original and thoughtful response to the DB question and contribute to the weekly dialogue by responding to at least two other posts from students. The first contribution must be posted before midnight (Central Time) on Wednesday of each week. Two additional responses are required after Wednesday of each week. Students are highly encouraged to engage on the Discussion Board early and often, as that is the primary way the university tracks class attendance and participation.

The purpose of the Discussion Board is to allow students to learn through sharing ideas and experiences as they relate to course content and the DB question. Because it is not possible to engage in two-way dialogue after a conversation has ended, no posts to the DB will be accepted after the end of each unit.

<strong>Background</strong>

For many years, antibiotics have been effectively used to treat bacterial disease; and pesticides have been used to protect our agricultural crops from many kinds of pests, including insects, worms (nematodes), fungi, or agricultural weeds, for example.

A growing concern for treating bacterial diseases or pest outbreaks is the evolution of antibiotic or pesticide resistance by bacterial or pest populations. Resistance means that a particular antibiotic is no longer effective in treating a disease, or that a particular pesticide will no longer prevent crop damage. This resistance can be viewed as evolution of a new trait at the population level, which is resistance to an antibiotic or to a pesticide. In this assignment, you will explore specific examples of antibiotic or pesticide resistance.

<strong>Assignment Details</strong>

Methicillin resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) has become a big concern in hospitals throughout the country and the world, as have other antibiotic resistant bacterial strains.

<strong>Part 1</strong>

<ul>

</ul>

<strong>Part 2</strong>

<ul>

 <li>How can you prevent or slow down the spread and further the selection of new antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria?</li>

 <li>Are there things that you can personally do to reduce your risk or even to reduce the spread of these dangerous microbes?</li>
